# emacs.d

Hi, I am a pythoner who use emacs everyday.

At first I fork the [purcell's config](https://github.com/Mellcap/purcell_emacs_config)

But I find that there are something I don't need and I comment some configs.

Finally I decided to build a emacs config by myself.

So, this is my emacs config just for python.
